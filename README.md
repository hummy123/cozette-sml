# cozette-sml

## Introduction

This is an attempt to "port" ASCII subset of the bitmap font [Cozette](https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette/) to pure Standrd ML code which can be rendered with OpenGL with just a vertex buffer, and no textures.

This is mostly used in my personal projects; I don't expect it to be useful for anyone else.

## Credits

This port would not have been possible without the original font by Slavfox.
